	# @Note <Yavor>: This cleans up the pane when we're done with gdb.
    #
	# Tmux always doesn't return panes to their original sizes when you close a pane
	# if there is more than one pane in a window. For example, if you have 1 pane
	# with an editor open, and you run this command, you would have 3 panes as a result:
	#
	#   1. One for the editor              - 1/3 the size of the window
	#   2. One for the gdb code listing    - 1/4 the size of the window
	#   3. One for the other gdb dashboard - 1/4 the size of the window
	#   windows.
	#
	# When you close one of the gdb panes, the other gdb pane would remain at
	# its original size instead of resizing to take the rest of the screen space,
	# so you end up getting:
	#
	#   1. Editor pane           - 3/4 the size of the window
	#   2. Original pane for gdb - 1/4 size of the window
	#
	# Instead, we want tmux to return to the original layout:
	#   1. Editor pane           - 1/2 the size of the window
	#   2. Original pane for gdb - 1/2 the size of the window
